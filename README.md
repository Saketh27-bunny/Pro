## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam or camera device
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster inference)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd event_monitor_dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Test the system**
   ```bash
   python test_models.py
   ```

4. **Run the system**
   ```bash
   streamlit run run_system.py
   ```

## 🔐 Authentication

### Default Admin Credentials
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

### Security Features
- **Password Hashing**: SHA-256 encryption
- **Session Management**: 8-hour session timeout
- **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions

## 🎯 Usage

### Starting the System

1. **Run the launcher:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run run_system.py
   ```

2. **Access the login page:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:8501`
   - Click "Go to Login" or navigate to the login page

3. **Authenticate as admin:**
   - Enter username: `admin`
   - Enter password: `admin123`
   - Click "Login"

### Dashboard Interface

- **📹 Live Camera Feed**: Real-time video stream from your camera
- **🚨 Alert Panel**: Shows active alerts and system status
- **📊 Statistics**: Tracks detection counts and performance metrics
- **⚙️ Controls**: Camera selection and sensitivity settings
- **👤 User Management**: Admin features for user management

### Admin Features

#### User Management
- Add new users (admin/standard)
- Delete existing users
- View all users and their roles
- Manage user permissions

#### Audit Logging
- View all system activities
- Track user actions
- Monitor login attempts
- Export audit data

#### System Settings
- Configure security settings
- Manage session timeouts
- System maintenance tools
- Backup and restore

### Detection Models

#### Fire/Smoke Detection
- Uses HSV color space analysis
- Detects orange/yellow colors associated with fire
- Configurable sensitivity threshold

#### Crowd Surge Detection
- Uses YOLOv8 for person detection
- Grid-based analysis to monitor crowd density
- Alerts when too many people are in a single area

#### Unconscious Person Detection
- Uses YOLOv8 for person detection
- Analyzes person orientation (horizontal = potentially fallen)
- Confidence-based detection to reduce false positives

## 🔧 Configuration

### Detection Sensitivity
- **Fire Detection**: Adjust threshold (1000-5000) for fire/smoke sensitivity
- **Crowd Surge**: Set threshold (1-10) for maximum people per grid segment

### Camera Settings
- Select from multiple camera sources (0, 1, 2)
- Automatic camera detection and fallback

### Security Settings
- Session timeout configuration
- Password policy settings
- Login attempt limits
- Two-factor authentication (coming soon)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication problems**
   - Verify default credentials: admin/admin123
   - Check if database file exists
   - Clear browser cache and cookies

2. **Camera not working**
   - Check if camera is connected and not in use by another application
   - Try different camera indices (0, 1, 2)
   - Ensure camera permissions are granted

3. **Models not loading**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check internet connection (models are downloaded automatically)
   - Verify CUDA installation if using GPU

4. **Performance issues**
   - Reduce detection frequency by modifying the frame skip in `main_dashboard.py`
   - Use a smaller YOLO model (change `yolov8n.pt` to `yolov8s.pt` for faster inference)
   - Ensure adequate CPU/GPU resources

### Testing

Run the test script to verify all components:
```bash
python test_models.py
```

This will test:
- Camera access
- Fire/smoke detection
- Crowd surge detection
- Unconscious person detection

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Change default credentials** immediately after first login
- **Use strong passwords** for admin accounts
- **Regularly review audit logs** for suspicious activity
- **Implement network security** (firewall, VPN) for production deployment
- **Backup authentication database** regularly
- **Monitor session activity** for unauthorized access
